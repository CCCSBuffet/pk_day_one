# Demos for Day One

Today is day one of CSC 1810. These are two programs that will probably appear to you to be gibberish. That's OK. You're in this class to learn to make sense of the gibberish.

## Why are we looking at these?

The purpose of looking at these programs is to, using the *debugger*, step through the statements and see how variables and *state* changes as a result of executing the statements.

## na.cpp

The first program outputs the chorus to the theme song from the 1960's Batman. You can experience it in all its glory [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9ymE2Rcxo).

Unfortunately, this program has a bug. Let's see if we can't find it.

## letter.cpp

This program is more complicated. It uses *functions* to break down complicated tasks into simpler parts. It doesn't contain any bugs (of which I am aware).

This program also contains an example of the `preprocessor` allowing me to write the program once but have it account for the differences between computer platforms. The preprocessor implements its own language which is apart from C++. Virtually all programs make use of the preprocessing to *include* certain utility files called *headers*.

## Follow along

It is likely that I will be demonstrating these programs while you download either `xcode` on the Mac or `Visual Studio Community 2019` on Windows. These programs are called IDE's or Integrated Development Environments. The word "integrated" is used because these programs combine what would otherwise be several.

* Editor - used to write your code
* Compiler - used to build your code into an executable
* Debugger - used to debug your code

Since your IDE's are not installed yet, just follow along with me.

## Aside: What is this file?

This is a *markdown* file. Markdown is a simple text formatting system that allows me to make reasonably expressive text files very easily. All of your project specifications will be delivered to you in this form.
