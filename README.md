# Demos for Day One

Today is day one of CSC 1810. These are two programs that will probably
appear to you to be gibberish. That's OK. You're in this class to learn
to make sense of the gibberish.

## Why are we looking at these?

For one thing, we need to fill time as you download your development
tools. For another, there is a lot to be gained by simply *reading*
code. We spend so much effort learning to *write* code, sometimes
reading code is overlooked.

## `na.cpp`

The first program outputs the text of the chorus to the theme song from
the 1960's Batman. You can experience it in all its glory
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9ymE2Rcxo).

Unfortunately, this program has a bug. Let's see if we can't find it.

## `letter.cpp`

This program is more complicated. It uses *functions* to break down
complicated tasks into simpler parts. It doesn't contain any bugs (of
which I am aware).

This program also contains an example of the `preprocessor` allowing me
to write the program once but have it account for the differences
between computer platforms. The preprocessor implements its own language
which is apart from C++. Virtually all programs make use of the
preprocessing to *include* certain utility files called *headers*.

### Follow along

It is likely that I will be demonstrating these programs while you
download your development environment. As this is the first day of
classes, you probably won't understand much of `letter.cpp`. Sit back,
relax, and follow along as best you can.

## Aside: What is this file?

This is a *markdown* file. Markdown is a simple text formatting system
that allows me to make reasonably expressive text files very easily. All
of your project specifications will be delivered to you in this form.

You should be thinking about creating a portfolio of work you can use
to score internships and then, in about 3.5 years, a full time job.
Markdown can help you in this regard as it is a simple way to build
good looking documentation.

[Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is a markdown *cheat sheet*.

### Two ways to view a markdown file

The first way to view a markdown file is via the web on coder
oriented sites like [github](https://github.com).

A second way to view markdown files is within Visual Studio Code.
Open a markdown file (a file ending in the letters `.md`). With
you cursor in the text of the markdown file, a markdown preview
can be displayed by pressing APPLE-k then v on the Mac. On
Windows, it would be CNTRL-k then v.

## Special keys on Mac and Windows

CNTRL is an abbreviation
for holding down the control key while pressing another key.
CNTRL is also abbreviated with ^ as in ^k+v meaning control-k
then v.

The APPLE key might be written as ⌘.

The ALT key is also used. On Windows, this is called the ALT key.
On the Mac, where people "think different", the key is called
"option" and is abbreviated ⌥.

## Other miscellany

Computer people have different names for a lot of things. The
less well we are understood by non-computer folk, the more money
we make. Just kidding. Not kidding.
